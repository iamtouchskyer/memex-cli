# memex

Persistent memory for AI coding agents. Your agent remembers what it learned across sessions.

## What it does

Every time your AI agent finishes a task, it saves insights as atomic knowledge cards with `[[bidirectional links]]`. Next session, it recalls relevant cards before starting work — building on what it already knows instead of starting from scratch.

```
Session 1: Agent fixes auth bug → saves insight about JWT revocation
Session 2: Agent works on session management → recalls JWT card, builds on prior knowledge
Session 3: Agent organizes card network → detects orphans, rebuilds keyword index
```

No vector database, no embeddings — just markdown files your agent (and you) can read.

## Install

### Claude Code (best experience)

```bash
/plugin marketplace add iamtouchskyer/memex
/plugin install memex@memex
```

Gives you auto-recall on session start, 3 slash commands (`/memex-recall`, `/memex-retro`, `/memex-organize`), and a SessionStart hook that injects your knowledge index.

### VS Code / GitHub Copilot

Search "memex" in the [MCP Registry](https://registry.modelcontextprotocol.io) and click **Install in VS Code**, or run:

```bash
code --add-mcp '{"name":"memex","command":"npx","args":["-y","@touchskyer/memex","mcp"]}'
```

### Cursor

Add to `.cursor/mcp.json`:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "memex": { "command": "npx", "args": ["-y", "@touchskyer/memex", "mcp"] }
  }
}
```

### Windsurf / Other MCP clients

Same pattern — add memex as an MCP server with command `npx` and args `["-y", "@touchskyer/memex", "mcp"]`.

### Codex

```bash
npm i -g @touchskyer/memex
```

Then add to your project's `AGENTS.md`:

```markdown
## Memory

You have a Zettelkasten memory via the `memex` CLI.
- Before a task: `memex search <keyword>`, then `memex read <slug>` for context
- After a task: `memex write <slug>` to save insights (pipe content via stdin)
```

## Upgrade

### Claude Code

```bash
npm update -g @touchskyer/memex
```

Plugin skills and hooks update automatically from the marketplace.

### VS Code / Copilot / Cursor / Windsurf

If you installed via `npx` (recommended), you're always on the latest — `npx -y` fetches the newest version automatically.

To force a cache refresh:

```bash
npx -y @touchskyer/memex@latest mcp
```

### Codex / global install

```bash
npm update -g @touchskyer/memex
```

## Browse your memory

```bash
memex serve
```

Opens a visual timeline of all your cards at `localhost:3939`.

## Sync across devices

```bash
memex sync --init git@github.com:you/memex-cards.git
memex sync --auto on
```

Cards are plain markdown — git handles merging and history.

## CLI reference

```bash
memex search [query]          # search cards, or list all
memex read <slug>             # read a card
memex write <slug>            # write a card (stdin)
memex links [slug]            # link graph stats
memex archive <slug>          # archive a card
memex serve                   # visual timeline UI
memex sync                    # sync via git
memex mcp                     # start MCP server (stdio)
```

## How it works

Based on Niklas Luhmann's Zettelkasten method — the system behind 70 books from 90,000 handwritten cards:

- **Atomic notes** — one idea per card
- **Own words** — forces understanding (the Feynman method)
- **Links in context** — "this relates to [[X]] because..." not just tags
- **Keyword index** — curated entry points to the card network

Cards are stored as markdown in `~/.memex/cards/`. Open them in Obsidian, edit with vim, grep from terminal. Your memory is never locked in.
